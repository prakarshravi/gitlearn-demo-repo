    Hello World!

        We're creating a situation for a merge conflict by modififying and committing the index.html file locally on a
        branch called merge-conflict-test,
        and then adding a similar body to the main branch, to simulate what happens when the master branch is modified
        by multiple programmers. <br>
        <br>
        This will hopefully result in a merge conflict that can be resolved either by committing changes from the master
        or stashing them before switching branches.
